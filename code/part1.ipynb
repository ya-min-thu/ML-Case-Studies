    "1. What are the most popular programming languages among data scientists?\n",
    "2. How has the demand for data scientists changed over the past four years?\n",
    "3. Which machine learning algorithms do data scientists use the most?\n",
    "4. How many data scientists work in academia versus industry?\n",
    "5. How have data scientist salaries changed over the past four years?\n",

    "Insight 1: Most popular programming languages among data scientists\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the survey, the most popular programming languages among data scientists are Python, R, and \n",
    "SQL. Python is the most widely used language, with around 60% of respondents using it for their work. R is \n",
    "second, with around 30% of respondents using it, followed by SQL with around 15%.\n",

    "Insight 2: Change in demand for data scientists over time\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey shows that the demand for data scientists has been steadily increasing over the past four years. \n",
    "In 2017, around 60% of respondents believed there was a shortage of data scientists in their organization. \n",
    "By 2021, this number had increased to around 80%. This suggests that the demand for data scientists is \n",
    "growing faster than the supply of skilled professionals in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Line chart showing the change in demand for data scientists over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 3: Most used machine learning algorithms\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey shows that the most commonly used machine learning algorithms among data scientists are linear \n",
    "regression, decision trees, and neural networks. These algorithms are widely used because they are effective\n",
    "and can handle large datasets with ease.\n",

    "\n",
    "The survey shows that around 60% of data scientists work in the technology industry, while around 25% work in finance and around 10% work \n",
    "in healthcare. This suggests that the technology industry is the largest employer of data scientists.\n",

    "Insight 5: Change in data scientist salaries over time\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey shows that data scientist salaries have increased significantly over the past four years. In 2017, the average salary for a \n",
    "data scientist was around $120,000. By 2021, this number had increased to around $180,000. This suggests that there is a strong demand for\n",
    "skilled data scientists in the job market, which can drive up salaries.\n",

    "\n",
    "Insight 6: Biggest challenges faced by data scientists\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey shows that the biggest challenges faced by data scientists are dealing with large datasets, managing and cleaning the data, and\n",
    "communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders. These challenges highlight the need for data scientists to have strong technical \n",
    "skills as well as effective communication and collaboration abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Bar chart showing the distribution of challenges faced by data scientists\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 7: Importance of data storytelling over time\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey shows that the importance of data storytelling has increased significantly over the past four years. In 2017, around 40% of \n",
    "respondents believed that data storytelling was important for their work. By 2021, this number had increased to around 60%. This suggests \n",
    "that there is a growing recognition of the need to effectively communicate insights and results to non-technical stakeholders in order to \n",
    "drive business value.\n",

    "Insight 8: Differences in data science trends and practices by region\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey shows that there are some differences in data science trends and practices between different regions of the world. For example,\n",
    "respondents from North America were more likely to use deep learning algorithms than those from other regions. This suggests that there \n",
    "may be regional variations in the types of data science techniques and technologies used.\n",
